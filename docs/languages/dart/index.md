Welcome to the Dart page! Here, you'll find a description of the language as well as a list of sample programs in that language.

## Description

[Dart][1] is a general-purpose language that was designed with five goals:

- Productive
  - Dart's syntax is clear and concise, its tooling simple yet powerful.
  Sound typing helps you to identify subtle errors early. Dart has
  battle-hardened core libraries and an ecosystem of thousands of packages
- Fast
  - Dart provides optimizing ahead-of-time compilation to get predictably
  high performance and fast startup across mobile devices and the web.
- Portable
  - Dart compiles to ARM and x86 code, so that Dart mobile apps can run natively
  on iOS, Android, and beyond. For web apps, Dart compiles to JavaScript.
- Approachable
  - Dart is familiar to many existing developers, thanks to its unsurprising
  object orientation and syntax. If you already know C++, C#, or Java, you can
  be productive with Dart in just a few days.
- Reactive
  - Dart is well-suited to reactive programming, with support for managing
  short-lived objects, such as UI widgets, through Dart's fast object allocation
  and generational garbage collector. Dart supports asynchronous programming
  through language features and APIs that use Future and Stream objects.

Since its inception, Dart has gone through different phases as Google tried to
sell its potential to developers. Google has rebuilt it's advertising service
AdSense with Dart. That demonstrate's Google's commitment to Dart by depending
on the language for it's main method of generating revenue.

The language also has many great features like garbage collection and a strong
typing system (as of Dart 2.0). All of it sits on top of a VM like Java, which
allows there to be less configuration between the test side and the source code.
A programmer can just get started from the get-go!
