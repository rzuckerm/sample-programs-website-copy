Welcome to the Picolisp page! Here, you'll find a description of the language as well as a list of sample programs in that language.

## Description

According to [Wikipedia], PicoLisp is a dialect of [Lisp][2] which was first 
developed in 1988 by Alexander Burger. Since then, PicoLisp has seen 
some variation including the latest [Java][3] version known as Ersatz PicoLisp.

In terms of features, PicoLisp is dynamically typed and simple/minimalist, sorry, 
info on the language is quite limited. For simplicity, PicoLisp only supports 
one internal data type, the cell. Beyond that, PicoLisp supports linked lists 
which means the language is an excellent list processor.

Today, PicoLisp can be found on [GitHub][4] as an open-source project. For more 
information, check out the [PicoLisp Official Website][5].
