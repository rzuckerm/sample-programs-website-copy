Welcome to the [Fibonacci](https://rzuckerm.github.io/sample-programs-website-copy/projects/fibonacci) in [Lua](https://rzuckerm.github.io/sample-programs-website-copy/languages/lua) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```lua
function fib(n)
  local a, b = 0, 1
  for k = 1, n do
    a, b = b, a + b
    print(k .. ": " .. a)
  end
end

if tonumber(arg[1]) ~= nil then
  n = tonumber(arg[1])
  print(fib(n))
else
  print("Usage: please input the count of fibonacci numbers to output")
end
```

{% endraw %}
