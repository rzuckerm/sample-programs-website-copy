**Note**: The solution shown above is the current solution in the Sample Programs repository as of Sep 04 2018 11:11:25. The solution was first committed on Aug 28 2018 15:40:04. As a result, documentation below may be outdated.

## How to Implement the Solution

Let's dive right into Hello World in Tex.

It is much simpler in Tex due to the fact the Tex is a markup language.

```tex
%&pdftex
```

This first line is a declaring line used to explain that the desired output of this tex file is a pdf.

```tex
Hello, World!
```

This is the body better known as what will be displayed. You could replace that text with anything to have it show up.

```tex
\end
```

Finally, this is saying the document has ended by declaring (`\`) an `end`.


## How to Run the Solution

There are many options for running Tex files both online and offline. This said my personal favorite option is running it online through [Overleaf][1]. They even cover the other options including themselves on their website [here][2].
