Welcome to the Longest Word page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

Given a string, this program should break it up into words and determine
the length of the longest word. In this case, a word is defined as anything
surrounded by whitespace. For simplicity, we'll restrict whitespace to the
following four special characters:

- Spaces: " "
- Tabs: "\t"
- Newlines: "\n"
- Carriage Returns: "\r"

For example, if we had a string, "How now brown cow", we can figure out which
word is the longest by breaking up the string into words. In this case, this
string has the following four words:

- "How"
- "now"
- "brown"
- "cow"

In this case, "brown" is clearly the longest word, so we'll return 5 as a result.


## Requirements

To satisfy the requirements, a program must accept a string on the command line 
and return the length of the longest word in the string:

```shell
$ ./longest-word-in-string.lang "Google do a barrel roll"
$ 6
```

In this case, we have a string with 5 words. It appears that there are two words
that share the largest number of characters: Google and barrel. Naturally, we
don't care to decide between the two words. Instead, we return the length of them 
both: 6.


## Testing

Every project in the [Sample Programs repo](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs) should be tested.
In this section, we specify the set of tests specific to Longest Word.
In order to keep things simple, we split up the testing as follows:

- Longest Word Valid Tests
- Longest Word Invalid Tests

### Longest Word Valid Tests

| Description | Input | Output |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| Sample Input: Many Words | "May the force be with you" | "5" |
| Sample Input: Single Word | "Floccinaucinihilipilification" | "29" |
| Sample Input: Multiline | "Hi,\nMy name is Paul!" | "5" |

### Longest Word Invalid Tests

| Description | Input |
| ----------- | ----- |
| No Input |  |
| Empty Input | "" |

All of these tests should output the following:

```
Usage: please provide a string
```
