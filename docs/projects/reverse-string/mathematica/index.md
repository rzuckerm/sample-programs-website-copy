Welcome to the [Reverse String](https://rzuckerm.github.io/sample-programs-website-copy/projects/reverse-string) in [Mathematica](https://rzuckerm.github.io/sample-programs-website-copy/languages/mathematica) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```mathematica
(* Code *)

(* The actual function operating on Mathematica strings is just the built-in StringReverse.  An outer function provides the 'user interface': *)

stringReverseMain = Function[{s},
   Catch[
    StringReverse[
     If[
      StringQ[s] \[And] \[Not] StringMatchQ[s, ""],
      s,
      Throw["Usage: please provide a string"]]]]];


(* Valid Tests *)

Print /@ stringReverseMain /@ {
    "Hello, World"
    };


(* Invalid Tests *)

stringReverseMain[""]
```

{% endraw %}
