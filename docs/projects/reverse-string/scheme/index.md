Welcome to the [Reverse String](https://rzuckerm.github.io/sample-programs-website-copy/projects/reverse-string) in [Scheme](https://rzuckerm.github.io/sample-programs-website-copy/languages/scheme) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```scheme
(define (reverse-string x)
  (list->string (reverse (string->list x))))

(if (> (length (command-line)) 1)
  (display (reverse-string (list-ref (command-line) 1)))
)
```

{% endraw %}

## How to Implement the Solution

As you can see, we can write a script to reverse a string in five lines of code (not counting the blank line).
In the following sections, we'll take a look at a breakdown of each of these lines.

### The Function Definition

```scheme
(define (reverse-string x)
```

The keyword *define* binds a function's definition to the specified name. This
keyword is followed by the name of the function and the function's argument. In
this particular case, the argument *x* is the string we want to reverse.

### The Function Body

```scheme
(list->string (reverse (string->list x))))
```

The whole magic happens in the second line. We will go through it step by step
from the inside out, since this makes understanding it easier.

The most inner pair of parentheses calls the conversion of our string *x* to a
list. Then, this list is reversed by calling the function *reverse* which is part
of the standard library. Finally, the reversed list is converted back to a string.
This is also the return value of the function *reverse-string*.

### Check if Enough Command-Line Arguments

```scheme
(if (> (length (command-line)) 1)
  ...
)
```

Let's look at this starting from the inner pair of parentheses.
*command-line* is a list containing the command-line arguments. The first value
is the name of the script. The rest are the user-specified arguments. The *length*
method returns the number of command-line arguments. The `>` takes two arguments
and indicates a "true" value if the first argument is greater than the second.
The *if* statement will only execute the code in the outermost parentheses
for a "true" value. Therefore, we only do something if the number of command-line
arguments is greater than 1. Otherwise, the program exits.

### The Display

```scheme
(display (reverse-string (list-ref (command-line) 1)))
```

The first thing you see there, is the *display* function. You'll probably remember
it from our Hello World experience, so have a look there, if you need a quick
refresher of what it does.

The argument to this function is the *reverse-string* function defined above. It
receives the second command-line argument (the string to reverse),
which is accessed with the function *list-ref*. *list-ref* takes two arguments:
the list and an index. In this case, the list is the command-line and the index
is `1`, which is the string to reverse. Finally, `display` outputs to reversed
string.

If you replace `(list-ref (command-line) 1)` with a string, the program prints that string
reversed. To show you an example, the output of
`(display (reverse-string "Hello"))` is *olleH*.


## How to Run the Solution

The quickest way is probably to try use an [online Scheme interpreter][1]. Just copy
the code above, drop it into the editor, fill in some input and hit run.

As an alternative, you can download [CHICKEN Scheme][2] and a copy of the solution
file from Github. Assuming CHICKEN Scheme is on your path, you can run the
script from a command line with the following command:

```console
csi -s reverse-string.scm
```

This will run the Scheme file which will print out whatever you enter on the
command line.
